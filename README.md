# Dogwebs

## Description

Dogwebs is a web application meant to be help people list and sell their dogs online with ease. The client can list their dogs for sale,browse and see other dogs and can order when they land on the page. When listing they can add or edit descriptive information about their dogs.

Dogwebs has both the client side and the admin dashboard. The clients who are not registered can view the dogs listed but they need authentication to add or edit information about their dogs. To get athentication a user has to register if they dont have an account then register or if they have an account they can login.

This is a Dogwebs website with a front-end made using React and a backend made with Ruby and Rails, and Postgresql. Rails and Postgress allowed us to create models, User and Dog with define relationships that could communicate with the database.

Rails helped in creating api endpoints that could be used by React frontend to get, post, delete and update dogs and its associates.
